We can only work with the tools that we are given. If something breaks ; it is likely due to something ZOS did that we need to adjust the code in response to. Give us time ; and we'll do it. We apologize for the inconvenience but ultimately it's out of our hands.; We develop these addons in our free time, and because we enjoy it. We have full time day jobs, families,  ; kids and pets. We do not create addons for the purpose of being paid. However, tossing us a few bones  ; eases the stress and frustration after endless hours of "code grinding" because it adds to that feeling of ; work "paying off". It also helps to say we make money on this when our significant others ask why we spend; so much of our free time doing it!; If you like what you see and want more of it, feel free to donate. Lack of donations will certainly ; not stop us from doing what we do. However, a flood of donations would certainly shift priorities; ; the choice is yours. Our primary hope is that you enjoy our work as much as we do.; Follow on Twitter @: @Calia_Gaming or catch up on Discord ->https://discord.gg/qGwxcMa; Please post bug reports and feature requests on ESOUI on the comments TAB for this Add-On or ; join the Discord server - https://discord.gg/qGwxcMa; Thanks!;	 Calia
